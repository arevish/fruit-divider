# Fruit Divider  ![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)
## Scenario
You got “n” number of apples. You wants to distribute the apples amoung your students. These “n” number of apples is provided to you by your friends, and you can request for few more or a few less apples.

You need to print whether a number is in range (mn to mx), is a divisor of “n” or not.

### Input:

Take input n, mn, and mx from the user.

### Output:
Print whether the numbers between mn and mx are divisors of “n” or not. If mn=mx, show that this is not a range, and mn is equal to mx. Show the result for that number.

## Example:
```
If n is 20 and mn=2 and mx=5

2 is a divisor of20

3 is not a divisor of 20

…

5 is a divisor of 20
```
